    "#6. Write a Python to find all duplicate characters in string?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In this tutorial, you will learn to remove all duplicates from a given string in Python. Strings in Python are \n",
    "   a sequence of characters wrapped inside single, double, or triple quotes. For a given string we have to remove \n",
    "   all the characters which occur more than once in the string. We will follow the order in which the characters appear. \n",
    "   For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input: \"stringis\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  Output: \"string\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "  To solve this problem, there are several different approaches,\n",

    "    1. using OrderedDict() and fromkeys() function\n",

    "  In this approach, we will use the OrderedDict() method from the collections class and fromkeys() in our program.\n",

    "  be duplicate keys this method will return the string after removing the duplicate characters.\n",
